About the Project
########

PyANC is a simulation toolbox developed for fast prototyping and empirical experimentation of Active Noise Control experiments. It helps researchers to quickly explore and iterate over a large number of experiments with varying conditions. The tool supports various types of signals, algorithms, transducer effects and room conditions. This way researchers can narrow down to few potential parameters. These parameters can be tuned to any user requirement scenario to find optimum performance.
